# Apsit-Hub
Apsit hub is a connecting platform for students of AP Shah Institute of Technology. MERN stack is the base of this project.

**Motivation**

I planned this Apsit Hub in SE mini project for college. The idea was to provide students a common platform to develope coding culture of the college. The main motive behind Apsit Hub 
was eliminate all the restrictions that other social media apps have. An open and free platform where approaching others should be the least of our concerns. The teachers have agreed to guide and deploy the project for the college as soon as its completed. 

**Future**

If things go right then it'll be merged with a similar platform of nearby colleges that my friend  @github/reeticodes is building. Expanding the community exponentially.
